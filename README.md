[Click here to download the nodejs version.](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Once you’ve downloaded NodeJS through their website, you should find the downloaded file inside of your downloads folder. Simply open this file by double-clicking on it and you will be prompted with a pop-up containing info about the NodeJS and NPM installation process.
3. Simply go through the next sections in this pop-up, and you will be prompted with this message once you get to the “Installation Type” section.
4. Click on “Install”, or if you want to change the install location, click on “Change Install Location”. This will start the NodeJS and NPM installation process. Once finished, you will be prompted with a final message displaying the location where NodeJS and NPM are installed.
5. As stated in the pop-up, to have access to NodeJS and NPM from your project’s directory, make sure that “/usr/local/bin” is in your project’s “$PATH”. To add “/usr/local/bin” to your “$PATH” on MacOS, run the following command in your project’s terminal: You can then click “Close” to close the pop-up.
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
6. To check if both NodeJS and NPM were installed successfully, in your project’s terminal, run:
node --version
and 
npm --version
